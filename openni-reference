Abstract: OpenNI is a standard interface for 3D sensor data processing
 algorithms. It is open for all (published on web site) and open source. The
 purpose is to define data types (depth map, color map, user pose, etc.) and
 an interface to a module that can generate them (sensor, skeleton algorithm,
 etc.), for 3rd party developers.
